# porypoke
Based on [inmortalkaktus](https://github.com/inmortalkaktus/)'s [ikpokeeditor](https://github.com/inmortalkaktus/ikpokeeditor-esp) for [pokeruby](https://github.com/pret/pokeruby), this tool's objective is to let people easily edit Pokémon data from the [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) project.

***Currently in early development.***

## Current new features compared to ikpokeeditor
 - Support for editing multiple Pokémon at a time without having to save when switching between them.
 - Option to individually saving a single Pokémon or saving everything.
 
## Planned new features
 - Support for [DizzyEgg](https://github.com/DizzyEggg/)'s Pokémon Expansion.
 - Multiple formatting options for saving files.
 - Multilanguage support.
